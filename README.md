pyXDF
=====

pyXDF is a Python importer for [XDF](https://github.com/sccn/xdf) files.

## Installation

The latest stable version can be installed with `pip install pyxdf`.

For the latest development version, use `pip install git+https://github.com/xdf-modules/xdf-Python.git`.

## For maintainers

A new release is automatically uploaded to PyPI. Therefore, as soon as a new release is created on GitHub (using a tag labeled e.g. `v1.16.2`), a PyPI package is created with the version number matching the release tag.
